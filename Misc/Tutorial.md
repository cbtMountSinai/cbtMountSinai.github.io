<h1 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"> Virtual Patient-Avatar Project <h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Overall Structure of Project </h2>
<p> This project can be broken up into two aspect</p>
<ol>
<li> Software Development </li>
<li> Graphic Design </li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Software Development</h2>
<p> Software development is ...</p>
<p> Sunny and I are in charge of this aspect.
<p> This can also be broken down into 2 aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li> Front-End Development </li>
<li> Back-End Development  </li>
</ol>

The software development aspect of this project is led by Sunny and I. 

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;"> Front-End Development </h3>
<p>
Front end development manages everything that users visually see first whether it's in their browser or application. Front end developers are responsible for the look and feel of a site. 
</p>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;"> Back-End Development </h3>
<p>
Back end development refers to the server side of an application and everything that communicates between the database and the browser.
</p>
<p>
<span  style="text-decoration: underline;">server:</span> A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network. <br>
<span  style="text-decoration: underline;">database:</span> is a system for storing and taking care of data (any kind of information)
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Graphic Design </h2>
* Disclaimer this section is written by Lenny Gonzalez, so it won't go in depth about the graphic design aspect. I can explain the basics of what is happening.
<p> The graphic design aspect is led by Lucas. She will hopefully be able to reuse the illustrations create by the former graphic designer. </p>

<p>
When creating characters/images on illustrator or photoshop, it's important that for each feature you have you create them on separate layers. This allows the image to be more "flexible", easier to work with from a designer point of view.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you're creating a human character on illustrator it's important that the left arm is on its own layer, the right arm on its own layer, and so on. Each body part get's its own layer, that way when the animation begins just that specific body part moves. If the eyebrow, or mouth is on the same layer has the head, when you try to animate the eyebrow you end up animating the entire face, which isn't what you want.
</p>

<h1 style="text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;"> The Two Aspects Coming Together </h1>
<p> 
The approach we're taking to bring this project to fruition, is similar to that of an Adventure book. 
</p>
<p>
Adventure books, allow the reader to make decisions throughout the book, and depending on what option the user picks they skip to the designated page 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when Lucas finishes animating all the scenes, we will take the movie file and "cut it up" at specific points. At each point a user interface will appear and give the user 4 options to choose from.
